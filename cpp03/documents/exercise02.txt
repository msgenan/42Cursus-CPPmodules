Making ClapTraps is probably starting to get on your nerves.

Now, implement a FragTrap class that inherits from ClapTrap. It is very similar to
ScavTrap. However, its construction and destruction messages must be different. Proper
construction/destruction chaining must be shown in your tests. When a FragTrap is cre-
ated, the program starts by constructing a ClapTrap. Destruction occurs in reverse order.

Same goes for the attributes, but with different values this time:
• Name, which is passed as a parameter to the constructor
• Hit points (100), representing the health of the ClapTrap
• Energy points (100)
• Attack damage (30)

FragTrap has a special ability too:
void highFivesGuys(void);

This member function displays a positive high-fives request on the standard output.
Again, add more tests to your program.
