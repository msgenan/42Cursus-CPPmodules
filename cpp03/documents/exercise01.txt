Exercise 01: Serena, my love!
Serena, my love!
Turn-in directory: ex01/
Files to turn in: Files from the previous exercise + ScavTrap.{h, hpp}, ScavTrap.cpp
Forbidden functions: None

Because you can never have enough ClapTraps, you will now create a derived robot.
It will be named ScavTrap and will inherit the constructors and destructor from Clap-
Trap. However, its constructors, destructor, and attack() will print different messages.
After all, ClapTraps are aware of their individuality.

Note that proper construction/destruction chaining must be shown in your tests.
When a ScavTrap is created, the program starts by constructing a ClapTrap. Destruc-
tion occurs in reverse order. Why?
ScavTrap will use the attributes of ClapTrap (update ClapTrap accordingly) and
must initialize them to:
• Name, which is passed as a parameter to the constructor
• Hit points (100), representing the health of the ClapTrap
• Energy points (50)
• Attack damage (20)

ScavTrap will also have its own special ability:
void guardGate();

This member function will display a message indicating that ScavTrap is now in Gate
keeper mode.

Don’t forget to add more tests to your program.
