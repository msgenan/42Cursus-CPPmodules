Exercise 03: BSP
Exercise 03

Turn-in directory: ex03/
Files to turn in: Makefile, main.cpp, Fixed.{h, hpp}, Fixed.cpp,
Point.{h, hpp}, Point.cpp, bsp.cpp
Allowed functions: roundf (from <cmath>)

Now that you have a functional Fixed class, it would be nice to use it.
Implement a function that indicates whether a point is inside a triangle or not. Very
useful, isn’t it?

BSP stands for Binary Space Partitioning. You are welcome. :)

Let’s start by creating the Point class in Orthodox Canonical Form that represents
a 2D point:
• Private members:
◦ A Fixed const attribute x.
◦ A Fixed const attribute y.
◦ Anything else useful.
• Public members:
◦ A default constructor that initializes x and y to 0.
◦ A constructor that takes two constant floating-point numbers as parameters.
It initializes x and y with those parameters.
◦ A copy constructor.
◦ A copy assignment operator overload.
◦ A destructor.
◦ Anything else useful.
To conclude, implement the following function in the appropriate file:
bool bsp( Point const a, Point const b, Point const c, Point const point);
• a, b, c: The vertices of our beloved triangle.
• point: The point to check.
• Returns: True if the point is inside the triangle. False otherwise.
Thus, if the point is a vertex or on an edge, it will return False.

Implement and turn in your own tests to ensure that your class behaves as expected.
