Exercise 00: BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ
Exercise : 00
Turn-in directory: ex00/
Files to turn in: Makefile, main.cpp, Zombie.{h, hpp}, Zombie.cpp,
newZombie.cpp, randomChump.cpp
Forbidden functions: None

First, implement a Zombie class. It has a private string attribute name.
Add a member function void announce( void ); to the Zombie class. Zombies
announce themselves as follows:
<name>: BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ...

Do not print the angle brackets (< and >). For a zombie named Foo, the message
would be:
Foo: BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ...

Then, implement the following two functions:
• Zombie* newZombie( std::string name );
This function creates a zombie, names it, and returns it so you can use it outside
of the function scope.
• void randomChump( std::string name );
This function creates a zombie, names it, and makes it announce itself.

Now, what is the actual point of the exercise? You have to determine in which case
it is better to allocate zombies on the stack or the heap.

Zombies must be destroyed when you no longer need them. The destructor must print
a message with the name of the zombie for debugging purposes.
