Exercise 03: Unnecessary violence
Exercise : 03
Turn-in directory: ex03/
Files to turn in: Makefile, main.cpp, Weapon.{h, hpp}, Weapon.cpp, HumanA.{h,
hpp}, HumanA.cpp, HumanB.{h, hpp}, HumanB.cpp
Forbidden functions: None

Implement a Weapon class that has:
• A private attribute type, which is a string.
• A getType() member function that returns a constant reference to type.
• A setType() member function that sets type using the new value passed as a pa-rameter.

Now, create two classes: HumanA and HumanB. They both have a Weapon anda name.
They also have a member function attack() that displays (without the angle brackets):

<name> attacks with their <weapon type>

HumanA and HumanB are almost identical except for these two small details:
• While HumanA takes the Weapon in its constructor, HumanB does not.
• HumanB may not always have a weapon, whereas HumanA will always be armed.

If your implementation is correct, executing the following code will print an attack
with "crude spiked club" followed by a second attack with "some other type of club" for
both test cases:

int main()
{
    {
        Weapon club = Weapon("crude spiked club");
        HumanA bob("Bob", club);
        bob.attack();
        club.setType("some other type of club");
        bob.attack();
    }

    {
        Weapon club = Weapon("crude spiked club");
        HumanB jim("Jim");
        jim.setWeapon(club);
        jim.attack();
        club.setType("some other type of club");
        jim.attack();
    }
    return 0;
}

Do not forget to check for memory leaks

In which case do you think it would be best to use a pointer to
Weapon? And a reference to Weapon? Why? Think about it before
starting this exercise.
