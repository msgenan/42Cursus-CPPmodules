Exercise 01: Moar brainz!
Exercise : 01
Turn-in directory: ex01/
Files to turn in: Makefile, main.cpp, Zombie.{h, hpp}, Zombie.cpp, zombieHorde.cpp
Forbidden functions: None

Time to create a horde of Zombies!

Implement the following function in the appropriate file:
Zombie* zombieHorde( int N, std::string name );

It must allocate N Zombie objects in a single allocation. Then, it must initialize the
zombies, giving each of them the name passed as a parameter. The function returns a
pointer to the first zombie.

Implement your own tests to ensure that your zombieHorde() function works as ex-
pected. Try calling announce() for each of the zombies.

Do not forget to use delete to deallocate all the zombies and check for memory
leaks.
